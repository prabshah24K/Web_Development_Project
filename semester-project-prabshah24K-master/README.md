<h1>Semester Project</h1>
<p><strong>For this course you will be required to complete a 5 page website as a semester project.</strong>
The website will be based on a topic of your choice. For example, you might choose to create a website about a special interest or hobby, 
or a family member/friend's business. You might even decide to create a portfolio for yourself.  Be sure to pick a topic suitable to be presented in class.</p>   
<p>The project will be divided into three major sections: the project proposal, comprehensive mock-ups, and website implementation. See below for a breakdown of each part of the project and due dates.</p>
<p>The project proposal and comprehensive mock-ups will act as a guide when you reach the implementation stage.  If you choose to change your topic after the proposal and mockups have been submitted you <strong>will not</strong> have to re-submit these documents.</p>  
<p>Both our classroom and Computer Lab B-9  will be available to you.</p>
